## PWM
Severe stroboscopic full-screen flicker, typically invisible (but easily detectable)

## Vcom (LCD screens)
Small flickering of separate pixels, visible with bad factory settings

## Inversion (LCD screens)
Small flickering of separate pixels, visible on test images

## FRC
Small flickering of pixels to create a color, potentially visible
