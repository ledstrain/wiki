List of very basic things to check before everything else.

## Basic issues with smartphones that can be fixed easily:

* [**Minimal brightness is too high**](https://ledstrain.org/d/21-usable-smartphones/14): There are many applications that can apply a black filter to the screen and thus reduce the screen brightness below the minimal system brightness, for example: Screen Dimmer, Screen Filter, Darker, Twilight.
* **Problems with auto brightness**: [Try turning off auto brightness and adjusting it manually](https://ledstrain.org/d/21-usable-smartphones/92), or [install a third-party application from Google Play](https://ledstrain.org/d/21-usable-smartphones/1943).
* [*citation needed*] **Rough surface of anti-reflective film, bad protective film or glass**
* [*citation needed*]  **Improper lighting conditions and a lot of reflected light rays from a glossy screen surface**
* **Wrong screen distance**: too far, to close
* **Screen too large /screen too small**: If a large screen creates too much light for you, try moving it away and at the same time increasing the font / scale of the elements.
If the screen is too small, then the eyes will strain, reading, especially if it has a very small font.
* **Using the screen in the darkness**: The same as with a minimal brightness: try software that apply a black filter to the screen and thus reduce the screen brightness below the system level, for example: Screen Dimmer, Screen Filter, Darker.
* **Incorrect brightness and color temperature setting**: A general rule of thumb for eye comfort is that white on the screen should look the same as white on a piece of paper in your lighting. Take a sheet of white paper, place it next to your phone and try to achieve:
the same brightness of the sheet and the screen the same shade of the sheet and the screen, the color temperature of the screen and the ambient light must match
* **Small font size**: Adjust the font to a comfortable size, enable scaling of screen elements - the picture should be comfortable, your eyes should not strain when looking at small objects.
* **Not sharp enough font, anti-aliasing problems**: On Windows there may be problems with font anti-aliasing, ClearType. There were no complaints about font smoothing on mobile operating systems; the factor is given here "just in case". So far, there is no data on it.
