List of very basic things to check before everything else.

## Basic issues with smartphones that can be fixed easily:

* [**Minimal brightness is too high**](https://ledstrain.org/d/21-usable-smartphones/14): There are many applications that can apply a black filter to the screen and thus reduce the screen brightness below the minimal system brightness, for example: Screen Dimmer, Screen Filter, Darker.
* **Problems with auto brightness**: Try turning off auto brightness and adjusting it manually, or install a third-party application from the GooglePlay.
* **Dynamic brightness**: A more malevolent version of auto-brightness: a built-in brightness adjustment in the firmware that cannot be turned off in the settings. This is how it is implemented on Nova 5T, for example. Dynamic brightness is easy to spot, but difficult to remove. Try asking on the forum of your device, which system file is responsible for this and how to delete it. Deleting system files can lead to some problems and bugs.
* **Rough surface of anti-reflective film, bad protective film or glass**
* **Improper lighting conditions and a lot of reflected light rays from a glossy screen surface**
* **Wrong screen distance**: too far, to close
* **Screen too large /screen too small**: If a large screen creates too much light for you, try moving it away and at the same time increasing the font / scale of the elements.
If the screen is too small, then the eyes will strain, reading, especially if it has a very small font.
* **Using the screen in the darkness**: The same as with a minimal brightness: try software that apply a black filter to the screen and thus reduce the screen brightness below the system level, for example: Screen Dimmer, Screen Filter, Darker.
* **Incorrect brightness and color temperature setting**: A general rule of thumb for eye comfort is that white on the screen should look the same as white on a piece of paper in your lighting. Take a sheet of white paper, place it next to your phone and try to achieve:
the same brightness of the sheet and the screen the same shade of the sheet and the screen, the color temperature of the screen and the ambient light must match
* **Small font size**: Adjust the font to a comfortable size, enable scaling of screen elements - the picture should be comfortable, your eyes should not strain when looking at small objects.
* **Not sharp enough font, anti-aliasing problems**: On Windows there may be problems with font anti-aliasing, ClearType. There were no complaints about font smoothing on mobile operating systems; the factor is given here "just in case". So far, there is no data on it.
