This will bring you to the source file on GitHub and you can make your changes there.

{{< details "Advanced" >}}

#### Linking

This site has smart internal linking.  
For example, `tests#dithering` will link to `/docs/appendix/tests#dithering`  

Sometimes, the directory structure will change to better reflect the content it holds.  
As long as linking uses the format of `pagename#section` internal urls will always work!

Additionally, internal linking is tested, to prevent urls from becoming broken if structure is changed.


### How to format content

For a introductory guide, see here  
https://www.markdownguide.org  
[Advanced formatting](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.29/)


Additionally, this site supports shortcodes.  

#### Shortcodes

##### Forum Post Embed

Posts on LEDStrain Forum can be embedded. Posts are cached, so changes to the 
original will be updated over time.  
Either format can be used to identify which post:
* Post ID: `11714`
* Permalink: `https://ledstrain.org/d/795-community-wiki/1`

Length can be specified to truncate content. {{< param "postlength" >}} is the default.  
length of `-1` will show the entire post, regardless of length.  

A domain can be specified, which can allow embedding content from other flarum
based forums. This is primarily useful with using Post ID.


```
{{</* forum-post 11714  */>}}  
{{</* forum-post id=11714 domain="https://ledstrain.org" length="300"  */>}}  
{{</* forum-post id=11714 length="-1"  */>}}  
{{</* forum-post "https://ledstrain.org/d/795-community-wiki/1"  */>}}  
```
{{< forum-post 11714  >}}
