Some users have had success by making their screen be "warmer"-colored - meaning, less blue and more yellow/red.
Most Android "color filter" apps just put a yellow/red transparent overlay on screen. This sort of works, but inherently reduces contrast.
CF.lumen is unique though: an app that lets you change color temperature by **directly reducing blue light emitted from the screen**. It requires you to root your phone first.
