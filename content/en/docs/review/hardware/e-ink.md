EInk devices doesn't cause problems to most of the people, including those who have eyestrain with certain devices, but for some, android 9 causes eyestrain.
Those users who have problems with android 9 even on eInk, ensure they don't have problem with android 4, 5, 6 or 7, being 8 or 10 not yet tested for android 9 sensitive users

A proposed way to fix, or lower, the eyestrain is to enter into Developer options and disabling Force GPU options and Hardware overlay option. Disabling anti-aliasing options may also help. (Android dithering thread: https://ledstrain.org/d/32-android-dithering)

Dasung Paperlike Pro 13" eInk monitor, 2019 version, also causes with some setups eyestraining problems, but for most of the people it is not the case. 

If your attached device outputs temporal dithering, the Dasung will display the dithering, and because of the lower refresh rate it will be even more visible than on a regular color display. So the PaperLike monitor is not a foolproof solution. But if your sensitivity is to PWM and blue light it will definitely help.
