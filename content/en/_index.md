#### What is LEDStrain?

The [Forum](https://ledstrain.org/) and Wiki are here to help with the impact
 light-emitting devices have on our health - particularly eye health.  
All are free to use and are community based!  


#### Existing Content  

A lot of useful information is available on the [forum](https://ledstrain.org). 
To make organizing this information easier, selected content can be
[embedded through shortcodes](ledstrain#forum-post-embed).   
You can identify existing content with a light blue background. Embedded content has 
its discussion title and author linked, to allow you to jump into any post on the forum!
